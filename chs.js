Some of them looked dusty and bent as if they had been nailed in somewhere else and pulled loose to reuse.": "道尔在工具箱前跪下，把布罩拉到一边。首先，他看到了锤子——它已经从布下面伸出来了——旁边是一个装满各种铁钉的木托盘。其中一些看起来尘土飞扬，弯腰驼背，好像是被钉在了别的地方，然后松脱下来重新使用。",
    "Doyle stepped up to the stone well, eyes on the wooden overhang above it. The water bucket it presumably once held now sat in the dirt at his feet, a mess of wet rope with a fish hook attached piled next to it. Then he glanced down at the workman's toolbox nearby, the cloth that had once covered the open top pulled aside.": "多伊尔走到石井边，眼睛盯着上面的木制悬挑。他脚边的泥土里，大概是曾经拿过的水桶，旁边堆着一堆湿绳子，绳子上挂着一个鱼钩。然后他低头瞥了一眼附近的工人工具箱，原来盖在敞口顶部的布被拉到一边。",
    "Doyle knelt down in front of the toolbox, the cloth covering pulled aside where he had left it. First he saw the hammer — it had already been sticking out from beneath the cloth — and next to it was a wooden tray filled with an assortment of iron nails.

    "Doyle knelt down to look at the box, then noticed a splash of red on the cobblestone. Nervous, he stood up and looked around, but he didn't see anybody. Then he peered over the edge of the well down into the dark below. There was the bucket on the surface of the water, wet rope floating next to it.": "多伊尔跪下来看盒子，然后注意到鹅卵石上溅起一片红色。他紧张地站起来环顾四周，但没有看到任何人。然后，他从井边向下凝视着下面的黑暗。水面上有一个水桶，旁边漂浮着一条湿绳子。",
    "Every footstep seemed to echo in the silence of the village square as Doyle walked along the cobblestone. He noticed another red splash just next to the well as he circled around behind it. Nervous, he ignored it, then put a hand on the stone edge to look down inside.": "道尔沿着鹅卵石路走着，每一个脚步似乎都在村庄广场的寂静中回响。当他在井后面转圈时，他注意到井旁边又有一个红色的水花。紧张，他忽略了它，然后把手放在石头边缘向下看。",
    "Doyle stepped up to the stone well, eyes on the wooden overhang above it. There was no bucket attached, or even a rope to hold one. Then he glanced down at the workman's toolbox next to it, the cloth that had once covered the open top now pulled aside to reveal a conspicuous empty space where the fish hook had been. A slight sense of guilt came over him.": "多伊尔走到石井边，眼睛盯着上面的木制突出部分。没有装桶，甚至连一根绳子都没有。然后他低头瞥了一眼旁边的工人工具箱，原来盖在敞口顶部的布现在被拉到一边，露出一个显眼的空地方，那是鱼钩所在的地方。他感到有点内疚。",
    "The village square was silent as Doyle sat down on the edge of the cobblestone well and pulled the coil of rope and the iron hook from his bag. Blondie watched him from next to the Golden Calf as he unraveled the rope — she must have thought it was some kind of treat he was preparing — and threaded it through the eye of the hook.": "多伊尔坐在鹅卵石井边，从包里抽出一卷绳子和铁钩，村子里的广场一片寂静。当他解开绳子时，布朗迪从金牛犊旁边看着他——她一定认为这是他正在准备的某种款待——然后把绳子穿过钩眼。",
    "On top were a collection of glass bottles, each with a paper label. Doyle only recognized a few of the bigger names — Dunmore Vineyards, and Light Manor, and Upton Brothers — but despite selling ale, he had never learned much about liquor or wine. An empty space between two of the bottles marked the spot where the rose salve had been.": "顶部是一组玻璃瓶，每个都有一张纸标签。多伊尔只认识几个较大的名字——邓莫尔葡萄园（Dunmore Vineyards）、光明庄园（Light Manor）和厄普顿兄弟（Upton Brothers）——但尽管他卖啤酒，但他对酒和葡萄酒从未了解多少。两个瓶子之间的一块空地标明了玫瑰花膏的存放位置。",
    "The rest of the box was less organized. In a pile Doyle saw a small hand-cranked auger, and a pricking knife that looked like it had dulled with use, and an assortment of different chisels still littered with wood shavings. Next to them was the empty space where the iron hook had been.": "盒子的其余部分没有那么条理。在一堆石头中，道尔看到了一个手摇的小螺旋钻，一把刺刀，看起来已经用钝了，还有一把各式各样的凿子，上面还散落着刨花。旁边是铁钩所在的空地。",
    "The rest of the box was less organized. In a pile Doyle saw a small hand-cranked auger, and a pricking knife that looked like it had dulled with use, and an assortment of different chisels still littered with wood shavings. Next to them was an iron hook, about ten inches long with enough room at the eye for a rope to pass through and be tied. It was probably meant for the well, Doyle thought, but as he glanced up at the wooden overhang, it was not clear to him how to attach it.": "盒子的其余部分没有那么条理。在一堆石头中，道尔看到了一个手摇的小螺旋钻，一把刺刀，看起来已经用钝了，还有一把各式各样的凿子，上面还散落着刨花。旁边是一个大约十英寸长的铁钩，钩眼处有足够的空间让绳子穿过并系好。多伊尔想，这可能是为了那口井，但当他抬头看了看木质的悬挑时，他不清楚该如何系上它。",
    "The center of the village square was marked by a stone well with a wooden overhang above the opening. Neat cobblestone extended out in a circle, which Doyle assumed would ordinarily be well-trodden by various townspeople bringing sloshing buckets back and forth. There was nobody to be seen, though.": "村庄广场的中心有一个石井，洞口上方有一个木制突出物。干净的鹅卵石延伸成一个圆圈，多伊尔认为这通常会被各市镇的人们来回提着晃动的水桶踩坏。不过，没有人可以看到。",
    "Next to the well was a wooden box with a carrying handle, the open top covered with a piece of cloth, except for the iron head of a hammer that poked out from underneath. A toolbox, Doyle thought. Somebody had probably been using it to repair something on the overhang. There was no bucket attached, after all, or even a rope to hold one.": "井旁边是一个带把手的木箱，打开的顶部覆盖着一块布，除了从下面戳出来的铁锤头。一个工具箱，道尔想。可能有人用它来修理悬挑上的东西。毕竟，没有装桶，甚至连一根绳子都没有。",
    "Gradually it approached, swaying and clanging against the stone sides of the well, until it was hovering just above the bucket below. A wire handle was fastened to each side of the bucket in a semicircle shape, and after a few tries, Doyle managed to swing the hook under it. Slow and cautious, he raised the bucket up until it was close enough to grab.": "渐渐地，它靠近了，在井的石头边摇晃着，叮当作响，直到它在下面的水桶上方盘旋。铁丝把手以半圆的形状固定在水桶的两侧，几次尝试后，多伊尔成功地将钩子挂在水桶下面。他缓慢而谨慎地把水桶提起来，直到离得足够近，可以抓住为止。",
    "Inside was an iron pry bar, half submerged in a shallow layer of water that sloshed as Doyle dropped the bucket onto the cobblestone. The workman must have dropped it, he thought. Again he glanced at Blondie as he pocketed the tool, a prideful nod in her direction.": "里面是一个铁撬棍，半浸在浅层水中，多伊尔把桶扔到鹅卵石上时，水哗哗作响。他想，一定是工人把它掉在地上了。当他把工具放进口袋时，他再次瞥了布朗迪一眼，骄傲地朝她的方向点了点头。",
    "Doyle glanced at the mirror again. There was the dirty beige tunic and the leather belt, the olive green breeches tucked into mud-coated leather books, and his mother's black linen cloak tied around his neck. It was all fine, he thought — a fellow salesman would understand the trials of the road — at least compared to his drooping expression, and that shaggy mustache and three-day stubble.": "道尔又看了一眼镜子。他穿着脏兮兮的米色束腰外衣和皮带，橄榄绿的马裤塞进泥泞的皮书里，他母亲的黑色亚麻斗篷系在脖子上。他认为，一切都很好——一个销售员同事会理解道路的考验——至少与他那垂头丧气的表情、蓬乱的胡子和三天的胡茬相比。",
    "After he tied off the rope, he draped the whole thing over the wooden overhang above the well like an oversized fishing line. Then he glanced back at Blondie as if she would be proud of him — her blank expression offered nothing — before leaning over the edge of the well and staring down into the dark. With his breath held, he began to lower it.": "他系下绳子后，把整个东西像一条超大的钓鱼线一样挂在井上方的木制悬挑上。然后，他回头瞥了一眼布朗迪，仿佛她会为他感到骄傲似的——她的茫然表情毫无意义——然后俯身在井边，凝视着黑暗。他屏住呼吸，开始把它放低。",
    "There was the dirty beige tunic he'd been wearing for days, and the brass-buckled leather belt that tied it at the waist, empty pouches and a coin purse hanging from it. There were his olive green breeches tucked into black leather boots, both coated a grayish-brown from dried mud, and the black linen cloak — it had been his mother's once, long ago — tied around his neck. He'd hoped to be more presentable for his meeting with Hadden, but after days on the road, any salesman would understand.": "他穿了几天的脏米色上衣，腰间系着一条铜扣皮带，上面还挂着空口袋和一个硬币钱包。他的橄榄绿马裤夹在黑色皮靴里，两条马裤都被干泥涂成灰褐色，黑色亚麻斗篷——很久以前是他母亲的一件斗篷——系在他的脖子上。他原本希望在与哈登的会面中表现得更得体一些，但经过几天的路途，任何推销员都会理解的。",
    "Then he punched the glass. It was a little too gentle, and the glass just rattled in the wooden groove that held it. Again he punched, and again it rattled, until finally he pulled back his fist and slugged it. The glass shattered with a satisfying": "然后他击打了玻璃。它有点太温和了，玻璃只是在固定它的木制凹槽中嘎嘎作响。他又一次拳头，又一次嘎嘎作响，直到最后他收回拳头，狠狠地打了一拳。玻璃杯碎得令人满意",
    "The face was less excusable. It'd been a long time since he'd seen himself in a mirror, and he felt like he barely recognized the man looking back at him. He had dirty blond hair cut short that should have been neatly combed, but instead looked disheveled from travel, his hairline receding faster than seemed appropriate for his 31 years. His lips were thin and his chin narrow, which gave his whole expression a slightly drooping character, and while there was no way to know for sure, he was certain that people noticed that before anything else when they looked at him.": "这张脸不那么可以原谅。很久没有在镜子里看到自己了，他觉得自己几乎认不出回头看着他的那个人了。他把脏兮兮的金发剪得很短，理应梳得整整齐齐，但旅行后却显得蓬头垢面，他的发际线消退得比31岁时看起来还快。他的嘴唇很薄，下巴很窄，这使他的整个表情有点下垂，虽然无法确定，但他确信人们在看他时首先注意到了这一点。",
    "The corkboard looked ancient, covered from top to bottom in pin holes and barren spots where all the cork had crumbled away. Clusters of loose pins poked from it here and there, and around them were various bits of parchment with black-inked notes scrawled across them, most crumpled and stained as if they had started their lives on the wet surface of a bar.": "软木板看起来很古老，从上到下布满针孔和贫瘠的地方，所有的软木都已碎裂。到处都有一堆松脱的大头针从里面戳出来，周围是各种各样的羊皮纸，上面潦草地写着黑色墨水的纸条，大部分都被弄皱了，染色了，好像他们是在酒吧潮湿的表面上开始生活的。",
    "Instead of a clue, he found a pile of loose tools and supplies, most rusted or broken, many that looked too old to be useful in any way. He rifled through them for a moment — an old wood scraper, and a balled-up pile of black-stained rags, and a cracked piece of wood that looked like it may have been a chair leg — before he found a": "他找不到线索，而是找到了一堆松散的工具和用品，大多数已经生锈或破损，许多看起来太旧了，无法使用。他翻阅了一会儿——一把旧的木刮刀，一堆成球状的黑色污迹的破布，还有一块看起来可能是椅子腿的开裂的木头——然后他发现了一个",
    "Doyle squatted in front of the trunk and pulled the latch — it was made of heavy iron with room for a padlock, but was hanging open and loose — then opened it, imagining he might find some clue as to what was happening in Cardwyke, or where the owner of the Golden Calf might be. The lid was heavier than he expected, and it banged against the wall as he lifted it.": "多伊尔蹲在车箱前，拉了拉门闩——门闩是用重铁制成的，可以装挂锁，但门闩是开着的，松着的——然后打开门，想象着他可能会找到一些线索，知道卡德威克发生了什么事，或者金牛犊的主人可能在哪里。盖子比他想象的要重，当他提起盖子时，盖子撞在墙上。",
    "Doyle scanned the parchments for anything relevant, but most seemed mundane: a list of food items probably meant for a market, and a series of names with a sum of gold coins next to each, and the start of a poem addressed to somebody named": "多伊尔扫描了羊皮纸，寻找任何相关的东西，但大多数看起来都很普通：一张可能是为市场准备的食物清单，一系列名字，每个名字旁边都有一堆金币，还有一首写给某个名字的人的诗的开头",
    "Doyle ran a hand across Blondie's mane again. She still looked nervous, swaying back and forth and clomping as if she might bolt at any moment. The town ahead was quiet — deserted, from what he could see — but she stared ahead, anxious, as if she could see something he couldn't.": "道尔再次用手抚摸布朗迪的鬃毛。她看起来仍然很紧张，前后摇晃，步履蹒跚，好像随时都可能逃跑。前面的城镇很安静——从他所能看到的来看，是一片荒凉——但她凝视着前方，焦虑不安，好像她能看到他所看不到的东西。",
    "— and once Doyle tried it, he'd agreed. Since then, he always tried to keep a neat chevron on his upper lip, carefully trimmed and maintained. He'd lost track since Yulan, though, and it had begun to creep over the edge of his lip, while the rest of his usually clean-shaven face had sprouted three days of patchy stubble.": "-道尔一试，他就同意了。从那以后，他总是试图在上唇上保持一个整洁的V形，并仔细修剪和维护。然而，自玉兰以来，他就失去了踪迹，嘴唇边缘开始出现皱纹，而他平时剃得很干净的脸上的其他部分已经长出了三天斑驳的胡茬。",
    "Again Doyle looked around, thinking some barkeep might emerge at any moment to scold him, but still the room was silent. With both hands he tried to pull open the sliding glass of the case, but it didn't budge. Whatever key fit that lock was probably with the barkeep, and the barkeep could have been anywhere. For all Doyle knew, they weren't even in Cardwyke anymore.": "多伊尔再次环顾四周，以为随时可能会有酒吧老板来骂他，但房间里还是一片寂静。他用双手试图拉开箱子的滑动玻璃，但玻璃没有动。锁上的钥匙可能是酒保的，酒保可能在任何地方。就道尔所知，他们甚至都不在卡德威克了。",
    "An expensive bottle of brandy brewed on the island of Astholme, off the Eastern coast of Eadmore. The blue-tinted glass signified its authenticity, and the wax seal over the cork was stamped with the wreath heraldry of Duke Wilton Slade of Astholme.": "一瓶昂贵的白兰地，在埃德莫尔东海岸附近的阿斯托尔姆岛酿造。蓝色玻璃象征着它的真实性，软木塞上的蜡封上印有阿斯托姆威尔顿公爵的花环纹章。",
    "With one hand still stroking Blondie's mane, Doyle reached into her saddle bag, feeling around for anything that might put her at ease. Usually, he kept treats for her — carrots were her favorite, so he stocked up whenever he could find them — but they had been on the road a while, and it had been a long time since he'd had any coin to spare. There wasn't much there.": "多伊尔仍用一只手抚摸着布朗迪的鬃毛，把手伸进她的马鞍袋，四处摸索着任何可能让她放松的东西。通常，他会给她留些零食——胡萝卜是她最喜欢的，所以只要他能找到，他就会储备起来——但这些东西已经在路上有一段时间了，他已经很久没有多余的硬币了。那里没有多少。",
    "What you've seen so far amounts to about 15% of the expected scope of the full game. While it's still in development, it's more finished than not, so keep an eye out for the full version in the coming months. If you want to support development and keep up to date on progress:": "到目前为止，您所看到的内容约占整个游戏预期范围的15%。虽然它仍在开发中，但它的完成程度比不上，所以请密切关注未来几个月的完整版本。如果您想支持发展并跟上进度：",
    "There was no response, but Doyle was almost certain he heard a sudden shuffling sound from one of the rooms. Each had a wood-carved number on the door — rough and uneven, like the carving downstairs — labeling them one through four. Nervous, Doyle clenched his fists, just like Mr. Fultan had told him back in Cotlin Hill.": "没有人回应，但多伊尔几乎可以肯定，他听到一个房间里突然传来了脚步声。每个人的门上都有一个木制雕刻的数字——粗糙而不平整，就像楼下的雕刻一样——从一到四标记着他们。道尔紧张地握紧拳头，就像富尔坦先生在科特林山告诉他的那样。",
    "There didn't seem to be any markings Doyle could find, though. Four other barrels were lined up next to it — they looked the same, unmarked, probably made somewhere in Cardwyke — and a few mismatched crates were stacked next to them, one uncovered just enough that Doyle could see clean linens and straw-stuffed pillows inside.": "不过，多伊尔似乎找不到任何标记。旁边还排列着另外四个桶——看起来一样，没有标记，可能是在卡德威克某地制造的——旁边堆放着几个不匹配的板条箱，其中一个没有盖好，道尔可以看到里面干净的亚麻布和草塞枕头。",
    "Then Doyle stood up, glancing at the wall of barrels and crates that dominated the other side of the room. There must have been enough provisions to last a month or more in there. Sighing, he thought of the stacks of unsold ceramics in his cart outside.": "然后，道尔站起身，瞥了一眼房间另一边满是桶和板条箱的墙壁。那里一定有足够的粮食维持一个月或更长时间。他叹了一口气，想到外面手推车里的一堆堆未售出的陶瓷。",
    "On top were a collection of glass bottles, each with a paper label. Doyle only recognized a few of the bigger names — Dunmore Vineyards, and Light Manor, and Upton Brothers — but despite selling ale, he had never learned much about liquor or wine. One bottle caught his attention, pocket-sized and made from blue-tinted glass with a cork stopper. He opened it to smell the contents.": "顶部是一组玻璃瓶，每个都有一张纸标签。多伊尔只认识几个较大的名字——邓莫尔葡萄园（Dunmore Vineyards）、光明庄园（Light Manor）和厄普顿兄弟（Upton Brothers）——但尽管他卖啤酒，但他对酒和葡萄酒从未了解多少。一个瓶子引起了他的注意，它是口袋大小的，由蓝色玻璃制成，带有软木塞。他打开它闻了闻里面的东西。",
    "Nobody answered, but again Doyle heard a shuffling sound and a muffled groan from inside. He glanced back over the balcony, Blondie's black mane just visible through one of the front windows. His heart was pounding, palms sweating. Again he knocked.": "没有人回答，但多伊尔又听到了一声沙沙的声音和里面低沉的呻吟声。他回头瞥了一眼阳台，从一扇前窗可以看到布朗迪的黑鬃毛。他的心怦怦直跳，手心出汗。他再次敲门。",
    "No response. In the center of the square was a stone well, and all around the perimeter were wattle and daub houses, the empty darkness of the windows staring back at Doyle. Interspersed between them were a handful of storefronts — a sign above one read": "没有回应。广场中央是一口石井，四周是用瓦片和灰泥粉刷的房子，窗户上漆黑一片，空空荡荡，回望着道尔。他们中间穿插着一些店面——上面写着一个招牌",
    "Nobody answered. Doyle ran a hand along the bar as he kept looking, stopping for a moment to stare up at the wall behind it. There was a wooden carving hanging there, ragged and uneven like a piece of driftwood; it looked like it was supposed to be something like a cow. The eyes were too large, though, each one a gaping black abscess on the malformed wood of the head.": "没有人回答。多伊尔一边看一边把手伸进吧台，停下来盯着吧台后面的墙看了一会儿。那里挂着一个木雕，粗糙不平，像一块浮木；它看起来像是一头奶牛。然而，眼睛太大了，每一只眼睛都在畸形的头部木头上形成了一个裂开的黑色脓肿。",
    "On the wall by the bed was a corkboard with various scraps of parchment pinned to it — most looked like lists and reminders scrawled in sloppy black ink — and below it was an iron-braced trunk, large and seemingly unlocked. On a wooden stand nearby was a tall, oval-shaped mirror, the glass dusty and speckled with dirt. Doyle waved at it, and his reflection waved back.": "床边的墙上有一块软木板，上面钉着各种羊皮纸碎片，大多数看起来像用黑色墨水草草书写的清单和提醒，下面是一个铁架的箱子，很大，似乎没有锁。附近的一个木架上有一面高高的椭圆形镜子，玻璃上布满灰尘和斑点。道尔朝它挥了挥手，他的倒影也挥了挥头。",
    "Nestled under the bar in a locked glass case was a bottle of Astholme Brandy. The last time he'd had a drink so decadent was about five years ago, on the night of his wedding. Nela's father had bought them a single bottle as a gift — it was an Astholme wine, actually, but close enough — and they polished off the whole thing before spending their first night together. That was a long time ago, though, before Nela had left, before Doyle had become an Atwater Associate.": "酒吧下面一个锁着的玻璃柜里放着一瓶阿斯托姆白兰地。他最后一次如此颓废地喝酒大约是五年前，那是在他的婚礼当晚。内拉的父亲给他们买了一瓶酒作为礼物——实际上是阿斯托姆葡萄酒，但离得很近——他们在一起度过第一晚之前就把这一切都做完了。不过，那是很久以前的事了，在内拉离开之前，在道尔成为阿特沃特合伙人之前。",
    "In the center of the square was a stone well, and all around the perimeter were wattle and daub houses, the empty darkness of the windows staring back at Doyle. Interspersed between them were a handful of storefronts — a sign above one read": "广场中央是一口石井，四周是用瓦片和灰泥粉刷的房子，窗户上漆黑一片，空空荡荡，回望着道尔。他们中间穿插着一些店面——上面写着一个招牌",
    "It was him. Despite the wavering of the man's voice, Doyle was certain. They'd run into each other at a tavern in Yulan a few weeks prior, their first time crossing paths again in over a year. Hadden told him stories about his time traveling through Eddon, and Doyle tried to put on a good face, but after a few flagons of cheap Alsporth ale, he couldn't help himself.": "是他。尽管那个人的声音有些动摇，但多伊尔还是很确定。几周前，他们在玉兰的一家酒馆相遇，这是一年多来他们第一次穿越小径。哈登给他讲了他穿越埃登的故事，道尔试图装出一副好面孔，但喝了几杯便宜的阿尔斯波特啤酒后，他情不自禁。",
    "It had been four days since Doyle left Fingate — that was the last populated area before Cardwyke — and nearly two weeks since he'd spoken to anybody before that. He hadn't sold anything in over a month. The back of his wooden cart was still filled with various designs of Atwater Pottery, each individual piece carefully separated by layers of burlap and hay, all of them jostling in place as they rolled over the uneven dirt road. He eyed one of the empty spaces where a hand-painted jug once sat; unfortunately, he had broken it during a pitch at the marketplace in Yulan.": "多伊尔离开芬盖特已经四天了，芬盖特是卡德威克之前最后一个人口稠密的地区，而在那之前，他已经和任何人交谈了将近两周。他已经一个多月没有卖出任何东西了。他的木推车后面仍然装满了阿特沃特陶器的各种设计，每一块都被一层层粗麻布和干草仔细隔开，当他们翻过崎岖的土路时，所有的陶器都挤在原处。他盯着一个空荡荡的地方，那里曾经放着一个手绘水壶；不幸的是，他在玉兰市场的一次投球中把球打碎了。",
    "He pushed the door open the rest of the way, but there was nobody there. Inside was a room that seemed to double as a bedroom and storage room; one side held a small, feather-stuffed mattress and a bookcase lined intermittently with leather-bound texts and cleaning supplies, while the other side was dominated by stacks of barrels and wooden crates, glass bottles sitting precariously on top.": "他在剩下的路上把门推开，但那里没有人。里面有一个房间，似乎兼作卧室和储藏室；一边放着一个羽毛填充的小床垫和一个书架，书架上断断续续地排列着皮革装订的文字和清洁用品，而另一边则堆满了桶子和木箱，玻璃瓶摇摇欲坠地放在上面。",
    "He patted her back, then lifted the wool blanket that covered the back of his cart to look over the remainder of his stock: 12 Atwater Classics Vases in the Ornamental Design, 17 Limited Edition Overglazed Bowls, and 19 Cooking-Grade Astholme-Style Serving Bowls. There had been 20 of each type in the initial set —": "他拍了拍她的后背，然后掀起覆盖在手推车后面的羊毛毯，查看他的剩余库存：12个装饰设计的Atwater经典花瓶，17个限量版外釉碗，以及19个烹饪级Astholme风格服务碗。在最初的集合中，每种类型有20个-",
    "Doyle sat on the edge of the feather-stuffed bed and looked around the room, one hand sliding across the sheets. A bookcase stood just ahead of him, and off to the side was an iron-braced trunk, a note-covered corkboard nailed to the wall above it. Next to the trunk was an oval-shaped mirror on a wooden stand, the glass dusty and speckled with dirt.": "道尔坐在羽毛填充床的边缘，环顾房间，一只手滑过床单。就在他前面有一个书架，旁边是一个铁支撑的箱子，上面的墙上钉着一块贴着便条的软木板。行李箱旁边是一个木制支架上的椭圆形镜子，玻璃上布满灰尘和污点。",
    "Doyle knelt down in front of one of the nearest barrels and looked it up and down for some kind of label. His first job had been selling barrels of ale just like that one for Fultan & Sons Brewery back in Cotlin Hill, and every one of their barrels had a logo stamped in black ink on the front.": "道尔跪在最近的一个桶前，上下打量着桶上的标签。他的第一份工作就是像在科特林山为富尔坦父子酿酒厂（Fultan&Sons Brewery）销售啤酒桶那样销售啤酒桶，每桶啤酒桶的正面都印有黑色墨水的标志。",
    "caught Doyle's eye on one side, and on the other was a hanging banner stretched across two buildings advertising the Cardwyke Fish Market, though the market itself was out of view down a side street. Cardwyke wasn't the largest castle town Doyle had passed through, but it seemed industrious. There was also an Atwater Ceramics Distribution Center somewhere out there, after all.": "一方面吸引了道尔的目光，另一方面是一条横幅，横幅横跨两栋大楼，宣传卡德威克鱼类市场，尽管市场本身在一条小街上看不见。卡德维克不是道尔穿过的最大的城堡城镇，但它似乎很勤劳。毕竟，在某处还有一个阿特沃特陶瓷配送中心。",
    "As he looked around the square, Doyle was struck by the silence. He didn't hear any of the bustle one would expect from a village in the late afternoon; in fact, he didn't hear anything but the occasional snort and hoof clomp from Blondie, as well as the sound of his own breathing.": "当他环顾广场时，道尔被寂静所震惊。下午晚些时候，他没有听到村里的喧闹声；事实上，除了布朗迪偶尔的鼻息声和脚步声，以及他自己的呼吸声，他什么也没听到。",
    "At the fourth door he paused, fists clenching and unclenching, his palms beginning to sweat. An image popped into his mind: the path through the woods on the way to Hemstoke, where he grew up. His father used to take him into the marketplace in Cotlin Hill — just half a day's walk down the dirt roads that all the farmers on the outskirts used — to help him sell the barley they grew. Afterwards, the old man would get drunk at a tavern not unlike the Golden Calf, and once his eyes began to droop and his mood began to sour, he'd send Doyle back home by himself with the cart.": "当他们走近村庄时，多伊尔轻轻拍了拍他的骡子——一只瘦削的灰色莫利，他管它叫布朗迪，尽管它的鬃毛上有一缕破烂的黑色毛发——并咕咕叫着让它慢下来。看到烟雾和村里的其他人出现在眼前，她似乎和他一样焦虑。在这一切的背后，隐约可见的悬崖峭壁俯瞰着无边无际的大海，是艾泽尔·卡登爵士的故乡盐堡。几座杂乱的塔尖在高高的砂岩墙上突出，紫色和白色的卡登家族旗帜悬挂在塔尖上。",
    "As they drew closer to the village, Doyle patted his mule — a skinny, gray molly he called Blondie, despite the ragged, black wisps that made up her mane — and cooed for her to slow. She seemed as anxious as he was at the sight of the smoke and the rest of the village coming into view. Behind it all, looming on a rocky cliff that overlooked the Endless Sea, was the Salt Keep, the home of Sir Edsel Carden. A few stray spires poked out above the high sandstone walls, purple and white Carden family banners hanging from them.": "当他们走近村庄时，多伊尔轻轻拍了拍他的骡子——一只瘦削的灰色莫利，他管它叫布朗迪，尽管它的鬃毛上有一缕破烂的黑色毛发——并咕咕叫着让它慢下来。看到烟雾和村里的其他人出现在眼前，她似乎和他一样焦虑。在这一切的背后，隐约可见的悬崖峭壁俯瞰着无边无际的大海，是艾泽尔·卡登爵士的故乡盐堡。几座杂乱的塔尖在高高的砂岩墙上突出，紫色和白色的卡登家族旗帜悬挂在塔尖上。",
    "Again he felt the coin purse on his belt, as if he might suddenly find something new there that he hadn't noticed before, but it was empty. Sighing, he glanced back toward the dirt road that had led him into town. It was a long way back to Hemstoke.": "他再次感觉到腰带上的钱袋，好像他可能会突然发现一些他以前没有注意到的新东西，但它是空的。他叹了一口气，回头看了看那条通向城里的土路。回到海姆斯托克有很长的路要走。",
    "A frayed red throw rug next to the bed seemed to delineate the two halves of the room: one for life, and one for toil. Doyle wondered if that actually worked for whoever lived there. It had been so long since he'd been away from Blondie and the cart that he found it hard to believe that somebody could actually separate things that way. Usually it seemed like toil was all.": "床边一块破旧的红色地毯似乎勾勒出房间的两半：一个是为了生活，一个是为劳作。多伊尔想知道这是否真的对住在那里的人有效。他离开布朗迪和马车已经很长时间了，他发现很难相信有人真的能用这种方式把东西分开。通常情况下，工作似乎就是一切。",
    "A few more seconds passed without response, then Doyle turned back toward the stairs. He slid a hand along the railing as he tried to calculate how many buildings there might be in Cardwyke — how long it might take to just check every side street until he found some sign that mentioned Atwater Ceramics — but before he reached the stairs, he heard a sound from behind the door.": "又过了几秒钟，没有任何反应，然后道尔转向楼梯。当他试图计算Cardwyke可能有多少栋建筑时，他用手顺着栏杆滑了一下——仅仅检查每条小街可能需要多长时间，直到他发现一些提到Atwater陶瓷的标志——但在他走到楼梯前，他听到门后传来了声音。",
    "\"Rose,\" he said to himself. The liquid inside was thick and oily, like some kind of salve, rather than a drink. Perhaps it was a medicine, he thought. It didn't seem likely that it would do any good for a major wound, but for something less severe, it struck him as useful. Again he looked around the room, almost expecting to see somebody watching him. \"I'm going to take this, okay? I'm sorry.\"": "\“罗斯，\”他对自己说。里面的液体又厚又油，像某种药膏，而不是饮料。他想，也许这是一种药。对于一个严重的伤口来说，它似乎没有什么用处，但对于一些不太严重的伤口，它对他来说是有用的。他再次环顾房间，几乎以为会有人在看着他\“我要买这个，好吗？对不起。\”",
    "A smaller path veered off from the main road just a few steps outside of the square, this one sloping downward, carving into the cliff face until it reached the sea far below. There he saw a pier lined with fishing boats and a few larger vessels jutting out into the water. Doyle could make out some buildings alongside it — something that looked like a tavern, and a sprawling warehouse topped with a sign that read": "一条较小的小路从广场外几步外的主干道转向，这条小路向下倾斜，一直延伸到悬崖表面，直到到达远处的大海。在那里，他看到一个码头，两旁排列着渔船，还有几艘较大的船只伸入水中。多伊尔可以辨认出它旁边的一些建筑——看起来像一个酒馆，还有一个杂乱无章的仓库，上面有一块牌子，上面写着",
    "The main road in Cardwyke was a long stretch of dirt marked only by heavy ruts probably dug in by wagon wheels and carts, just like Doyle's. Small pools of muddy water spotted the road in deeper pits where it still hadn't dried. There was nobody out, even further ahead.": "The main road in Cardwyke was a long stretch of dirt marked only by heavy ruts probably dug in by wagon wheels and carts, just like Doyle's. Small pools of muddy water spotted the road in deeper pits where it still hadn't dried. There was nobody out, even further ahead.",
    "The interior was as silent as the village square. Matching wooden tables populated the first floor, and an unpolished bar spanned the back of the room. A row of brown glass bottles — local brews, most likely, plus a few imports from Astholme or Igban — lined the counter-top behind it. At the end of the bar was a door hanging slightly ajar, with a hand-made sign nailed to it that read": "内部像乡村广场一样寂静。一楼摆满了相配的木桌，房间后面有一个未抛光的吧台。一排棕色玻璃瓶——很可能是当地酿造的，再加上从阿斯托姆或伊格班进口的一些——排列在柜台后面。酒吧的尽头是一扇门，微微半开着，上面钉着一个手工制作的牌子，上面写着",
    "The graying door to the Golden Calf creaked as Doyle nudged it open, glancing back at Blondie as if she might offer some expression of reassurance. She gave him nothing, though. Hesitant, Doyle stepped inside, mud-caked rushes shifting beneath his feet as he shut the door behind him.": "当多伊尔轻轻推开金色小牛犊的灰色门时，门吱吱作响，回头看了看金发碧眼的布朗迪，似乎她可以表达一些安慰的表情。但她什么也没给他。道尔犹豫了一下，走了进去，身后关上门时，粘满泥的灯心草在脚下移动。",
    "The floor behind the bar was littered with broken glass. Some of those brown bottles must have dropped at some point; the wood was still wet, though, so it couldn't have been long ago. Doyle pictured shattered bits of ceramic in the dirt in the marketplace in Yulan, then let out a heavy sigh.": "酒吧后面的地板上散落着碎玻璃。那些棕色的瓶子一定是在什么时候掉下来的；不过，木头还是湿的，所以不可能很久以前就湿了。多伊尔在玉兰市集的泥土中拍下了碎瓷片，然后重重地叹了一口气。",
    "Something about Blondie's disposition seemed off to Doyle. She looked nervous, swaying back and forth and clomping as if she might bolt at any moment. Even as Doyle placed a hand on her head and stroked her well-brushed mane, she seemed to look past him, behind him, as if searching for something.": "多伊尔似乎对布朗迪的性格有些不满。她看起来很紧张，前后摇晃，步履蹒跚，好像随时都可能逃跑。就在多伊尔把手放在头上，抚摸着她梳得很好的鬃毛时，她似乎从他身边、在他身后看过去，好像在寻找什么东西。",
    "The first thing Doyle saw was the smoke. It billowed thick and black above the rooftops of Cardwyke, various smoldering sources just out of sight behind the yellow-daubed walls of the closest houses. A nervous pit began to form in his stomach, but he knew he couldn't turn back. One hand absent-mindedly pawed at the empty coin pouch on his belt.": "道尔首先看到的是烟雾。它在卡德威克的屋顶上滚滚浓烟，黑色的，各种阴燃源就在最近的房子的黄色涂墙后面看不见。他的胃里开始形成一个神经凹坑，但他知道自己无法回头。一只手心不在焉地抓着腰带上的空硬币袋。",
    "The Salt Keep is a fantasy/horror text RPG. All action is described through text, but you choose where to go and what to do, what abilities to prioritize via equipment and level-ups, and when to take risks in percentage-based challenges. While injuries are possible, death and dead-ends are not, so don't hesitate to try things out.": "《盐堡》是一部幻想/恐怖文本RPG。所有行动都通过文本进行描述，但您可以选择去哪里做什么，通过设备和升级来优先考虑什么能力，以及何时在基于百分比的挑战中承担风险。虽然受伤是可能的，但死亡和死胡同是不可能的，所以不要犹豫，尝试一下吧。",
    "Towering above all of it, at the end of the main road where the upward slope peaked, was the Salt Keep. From where he stood, most of what Doyle could see were the sandstone walls and the iron portcullis of the front gate, though the tops of three towers loomed above them, the smaller two on either side and the larger in the center. Purple and white banners flew from poles atop each of them.": "盐堡高耸入云，位于向上倾斜的主道尽头。从他站的地方看，多伊尔能看到的大部分是沙岩墙和前门的铁门，尽管三座塔楼的顶部隐约可见，较小的两座在两侧，较大的在中间。紫色和白色的横幅从每根柱子上飘扬。",
